The AI engineer's work began by addressing a user-reported failed to fetch members error, traced to a flawed name splitting logic during CSV imports in  that left  missing in member records. After initial database cleanup attempts and fixing the  configuration, the engineer successfully purged problematic members and refined the name splitting logic, restoring the Members page functionality.

Subsequently, a new user request to implement improvements from a  document led to a comprehensive 5-phase upgrade plan. Phases 1-3 were largely implemented:
1.  **Enhanced Duplicate Detection**: Introduced  and updated  to use normalized fields in the  model and duplicate checks.
2.  **Audit Logging System**: Added  model and middleware to .
3.  **Blocked Members Report**: Implemented  model and API endpoints in , logging blocked duplicate attempts during manual creation and CSV imports.
Phases 4 (Enhanced RBAC) and 5 (Summary Reports) were initiated with file creation/endpoint additions. Intermediate testing confirmed core functionality, with minor API response formatting issues noted.

The ERP360 gym management application is designed as a full-stack solution encompassing member management, access control, financial operations, and marketing. Core features include Member Management, Access Control, Membership Plans, Billing & Invoicing, a Member Portal, Dashboards, Staff Management, Cancellation Workflows, Sales Commission Engine, and WhatsApp (Respond.io) integration. A central Automation/Triggers engine supports .

Initial development focused on payment system enhancements: automatic debt calculation, editable payment sources, and payment analytics dashboards. This was largely completed.

The ongoing Incremental Rebuild aims to expand functionality based on a new set of specifications (from , , , , ). Key features in development include:
-   Core Scheduling (Classes & Bookings)
-   Enhanced Access Control with check-in analytics
-   A redesigned generic Automations module
-   A comprehensive Data Import module with field mapping and duplicate handling
-   Robust Duplicate Data Entry Protection, including an admin-configurable mandatory field system.
The latest improvements derived from a  include enhanced duplicate detection, an audit logging system, a blocked members report, enhanced RBAC, and a summary reports dashboard.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a user report that the data import function is still not working, despite previously fixing the failed to fetch members issue and verifying the Members page.

The  page UI was confirmed to be working, allowing file uploads and displaying preview data. However, the auto-mapping feature was found to only partially work, correctly identifying Email and Mobile Phone but failing to map a Full Name column from the CSV to the required First Name and Last Name fields. The AI noted that manual mapping would be required for these fields.

Concurrently, the user provided a  file and requested improvements we can make to our app based on its content. The AI engineer formulated a comprehensive 5-phase upgrade plan:
1.  **Enhanced Duplicate Detection**: Implemented by creating , updating the  model in  with normalized fields (, , , ), and modifying  and  endpoints to utilize these normalized fields for improved duplicate detection.
2.  **Audit Logging System**: Implemented by adding an  Pydantic model and corresponding middleware to  to capture API request details.
3.  **Blocked Members Report**: Implemented by adding a  model and new API endpoints (, ) to . The  function and the  function were updated to log these blocked duplicate attempts.
4.  **Enhanced RBAC & Permissions**: Initiated by creating a new file  and adding an endpoint for user permissions in .
5.  **Summary Reports Dashboard**: Initiated by adding a summary reports endpoint in .

After implementing Phases 1-3, and initiating 4 and 5, the AI performed deep testing of the backend (normalization and audit logging), which showed 85% overall success, with a note about minor API response format differences needing attention. The user then explicitly requested to continue with further phases.
