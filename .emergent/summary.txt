The previous AI engineer successfully implemented a robust RBAC system and a fully functional Point of Sale (POS) system, including member linking, stock management, per-item discounts, and Epson thermal receipt generation. The current trajectory begins after POS completion, with the user introducing a new task: integrating an EFT SDV file format based on provided documentation. The AI engineer initiated this by downloading, unzipping, and attempting to extract specifications from PDF documents, specifically . Facing difficulties in precise extraction, the engineer then reviewed  and is currently inspecting  to better understand the existing backend context for billing and payment processes, aiming to identify where the EFT SDV integration would fit.

<product_requirements>
The ERP360 gym management application is a full-stack solution for member management, access control, finance, and marketing, undergoing an Incremental Rebuild.
**RBAC:** Required roles (Business Owner, Head of Admin, Department Heads, Personal Trainers, Club Managers) with granular permissions (View/Create/Edit/Delete for Members, Billing, Access Control, Classes, Marketing, Staff, Reports, Data Import, Settings, Audit Logs). An admin UI for staff role assignment and permission viewing was necessary.
**POS System:** Needed to handle account/debt payments, product management (cost, markup, categories), membership/session payments, automatic stock deduction, percentage discounts, 15% tax/VAT, printable/downloadable receipts (Epson thermal), and link transactions to member accounts.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Architecture**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB ().
- **UI/UX**: Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend**: Pydantic for data validation, UUIDs for IDs, JWT auth, .
- **Data Management**: Data Normalization, RBAC (custom logic), POS (transactional, stock).
- **Receipt Generation**: Epson thermal printer format.

<code_architecture>

-   ****: Centralizes API logic, Pydantic models, and database interactions. It handles RBAC (roles, permissions, user assignment) and POS (categories, products, transactions, per-item discounts, member linking, stock management).  fields are removed from responses.
-   ****: Contains helper functions for normalizing data like emails and phone numbers.
-   ****: Defines roles, permissions, and RBAC utility functions.
-   ****: Provides initial data for POS products and categories for testing.
-   ****: Main frontend routing. Routes for RBAC and POS were added.
-   ****: Navigation sidebar with RBAC and POS links.
-   ****: UI for RBAC permission management.
-   ****: UI for staff role assignment.
-   ****: Core POS interface. Integrates live APIs, per-item discounts, thermal printer utility, and a receipt printing dialog. All mock data has been removed.
-   ****: UI for managing POS products and categories.
-   ****: **NEW file**. Encapsulates logic for formatting Epson thermal printer receipts.
-   ****: Documents user problem statements, testing data, and agent communications. Updated with RBAC and POS implementation details and test results.

<pending_tasks>
- Implement full billing automation (invoice process, CSV generation, payment gateway integration).
- Complete the summary reports dashboard.
- Address minor API response format differences for full compatibility.
- Integrate Social Media lead capture.
- Complete the sales commission engine logic and UI.
- Implement remaining aspects of the POS system (e.g., quick access for favorite products).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer had successfully completed and thoroughly tested the full Point of Sale (POS) system. This involved implementing comprehensive features such as per-item discount functionality, linking transactions to member accounts, robust stock management, and generating printable/downloadable receipts in Epson thermal format. Both backend () and frontend (, ) components were developed, eliminating all reliance on mock data and fully integrating with live APIs. All automated tests passed with 100% success, confirming the system's stability and functionality.

Following the completion of the POS system, the user requested the integration of an EFT SDV (Same Day Value) file format. The AI engineer has initiated this task by downloading and extracting several PDF documents provided by the user, specifically focusing on . The engineer has attempted to extract the precise EFT SDV file format specifications from these documents but encountered challenges in pinpointing the exact details. To gain better context and inform the integration, the engineer has reviewed the  file and is currently in the process of examining the  backend file.
