The AI engineer's work has progressed systematically, focusing on expanding the ERP360 gym management system. Initially, the core task involved integrating an Attendance by Day Heatmap into the Members Dashboard and enhancing the Sales Dashboard with comprehensive analytics and drill-down capabilities. A critical frontend syntax error in  was identified and promptly fixed. Following successful implementation and testing of these features, the scope expanded to building a robust lead allocation system within the Sales CRM, including role-based visibility and assignment APIs. Most recently, the engineer initiated the development of a Complimentary Membership Tracking System, completing the backend models and APIs, while simultaneously addressing a new user request to analyze a provided document for potential feature gaps in the existing system. The process has been iterative, involving frequent user clarifications and adherence to testing protocols.

<product_requirements>
The ERP360 application manages gym financials and members. Core functionalities include EFT, billing, RBAC, member management, and engagement features. The All Members screen has evolved with Dashboard Enhancements, Retention Intelligence, Reporting, Advanced Analytics, and Engagement Features (points/rewards, global search). A new Sales Management Module is the primary focus. Phase 1 included Contact, Lead, Sales Pipeline, Task, and Basic Reporting. Phase 2 requires Sales Automation, Workflow Automation, an Advanced Analytics Dashboard (with drill-downs), configurable lead sources/statuses/loss reasons, and an Attendance by Day Heatmap for the Members Dashboard (hourly granularity). Latest additions require a lead allocation system for sales managers to assign leads to consultants with role-based visibility, notifications, and filters. A Complimentary Membership Tracking System is also needed to track usage of complimentary passes, notify consultants on visits (1st, 2nd, 3rd configurable), highlight non-users, count expired passes, manage multiple membership types, auto-create leads, and provide dashboard metrics like utilization and conversion rates.

<pending_tasks>
- **Frontend**: Build visual drag-and-drop builders for Workflow Automation.
- **Frontend**: Develop comprehensive dashboard analytics components for Sales (remaining parts, drill-down capabilities beyond current).
- **Frontend**: Implement the Complimentary Membership Tracking System UI and integrate it into the Sales CRM Dashboard.
- **Backend**: Integrate full billing automation (e.g., payment gateway).
- **General**: Complete summary reports dashboard (beyond transaction reconciliation).
- **Integration**: Replace mock implementations with actual third-party integrations (e.g., email services, notification systems, WhatsApp Business API, Calendar integration) when API keys become available.
- **Analysis**: Compare  with current build to identify feature gaps.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was implementing the Complimentary Membership Tracking System. The backend portion of this feature has been completed: new Pydantic models (, , ) have been added to , and comprehensive CRUD and analytics APIs for managing these memberships (e.g., creating types, issuing passes, tracking access, fetching utilization reports) were implemented after the sales consultants endpoints. The backend was restarted and reported successful startup.

Concurrently, the user uploaded a document, , and requested an analysis to identify any gaps in the currently built system compared to the document's specifications. The AI engineer has confirmed file analysis completion and is now preparing to compare the document against the existing application's features to find these gaps. The frontend implementation for the complimentary membership system is pending this gap analysis and subsequent planning.
