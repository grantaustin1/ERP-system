The trajectory details the ERP360 application's evolution, starting with financial and member management features. Initially, the AI engineer integrated EFT SDV, DebiCheck, AVS, and TI, redesigning the Settings page into a mega-menu and introducing a Debit Order Management module. Subsequent work included enhancing levy options, staff management links, and member search/engagement alerts.

A significant phase focused on templated notifications, their integration into automation triggers, and improvements to class booking with searchable member selection and auto-advancing date inputs. Critical fixes addressed CORS and datetime handling. The dashboard gained hierarchical drill-down functionality across all statistical tiles, culminating in adding a drill-down to individual member profiles on the Members tab.

Further development introduced a comprehensive Member Journal System to log all member interactions and a Tasking System for internal staff collaboration, including configurable task types, assignment, priority, and status. The Access Override feature was implemented to manage exceptions for member access. Throughout, the AI engineer addressed several bugs, including unseeded task types, frontend  errors, and a state management issue affecting tab visibility in the  page, often utilizing a troubleshoot agent for root cause analysis.

1.  **Financials**: EFT SDV, DebiCheck, Advance Billing, Debit Order Management, AVS, TI, and improved Levy System.
2.  **UI/UX**: Mega-menu Settings redesign, member search, engagement alerts dashboard, drill-down on all dashboard tiles (including class bookings), and drill-down to individual member profiles on the Members page.
3.  **Notifications & Automations**: Template-based notifications (WhatsApp, email, SMS, push), template management in Settings, and integration of templates with automation triggers.
4.  **Classes**: Searchable member selector, auto-advancing date selection, aggregated class bookings view, class capacity management, attendance tracking (with no-show logic), and automated booking confirmations/reminders.
5.  **Member Management**: Comprehensive Member Journal system to log all interactions (messages, profile changes, access), displayed in a dedicated tab with filtering.
6.  **Task Management**: A Tasking System allowing users to task each other, with configurable task types, assignment (individual/department), priority levels, statuses, comments, attachments, and due dates. Tasks can be created from a dedicated page, member profiles, auto-generated from cancellation requests, email integration, and automation triggers.
7.  **Access Control**: An Access Override function with configurable hierarchical reasons, search for existing/expired members, PIN input, permission-based authorization, override logging, and daily/weekly limits. It also handles auto-creation of temporary records for new prospects.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was working on fixing a critical frontend visibility issue within the  page. Specifically, tabs like Member Engagement Alerts, Notification Templates, and Task Types were not displaying correctly. The troubleshoot agent identified the root cause as a state management issue, where the  hook responsible for fetching initial data was not correctly linked to dependencies like  or , preventing data from being fetched or tabs from rendering.

The AI engineer implemented a fix by adjusting the  hook to ensure  was properly called when  or  changed. This ensures that all settings tabs requiring initial data are correctly populated and displayed. The system is currently in a state where these previously hidden settings tabs should now be fully visible and functional, allowing users to configure task types and other system settings.
