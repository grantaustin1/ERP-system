The AI engineer successfully completed the initial RBAC system, including detailed roles, permissions, API endpoints, and frontend UI components. Following this, the focus shifted to implementing a Point of Sale (POS) system. Initial POS development established core functionalities, though it relied on local test data and mock modes due to  discrepancies.

The trajectory then details the completion of the POS system. User confirmation guided the implementation towards printable/downloadable receipts (Epson thermal), comprehensive discount support, and linking transactions to member accounts. The engineer systematically removed all mock data, implemented per-item discount logic in  and , created a  utility, and integrated a receipt printing dialog. Extensive backend and frontend testing confirmed 100% functionality for all new POS features, including member linking, payment allocation, stock management, and various transaction types. The current state is a fully functional and tested POS system, leading to a new user query regarding billing automation.

The ERP360 gym management application aims to be a full-stack solution encompassing member management, access control, financial operations, and marketing. Recent efforts included payment system enhancements. The Incremental Rebuild is expanding functionality, with RBAC and POS being key areas.

**RBAC Specifics:** Defined roles (Business Owner, Head of Admin, Department Heads, Personal Trainers, Club Managers) with granular permissions (View/Create/Edit/Delete for Members, Billing, Access Control, Classes, Marketing, Staff, Reports, Data Import, Settings, Audit Logs). An admin UI for staff/user role assignment and permission viewing was required.

**POS System Requirements:** Needed to handle account/debt payments linked to user, payment purpose dropdowns, product management (cost, markup, categories), membership/session payments, stock management with automatic deduction, percentage discounts, 15% tax/VAT, printable/downloadable receipts (Epson thermal format), and quick access for popular products. Transactions must be linked to member accounts.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully completed the full implementation and testing of the Point of Sale (POS) system. This involved addressing user requirements for printable receipts (Epson thermal format), per-item discount functionality, and linking transactions to member accounts.

Key achievements in this phase include:
-   **Backend ()**: Ensured all necessary models and API endpoints supported per-item discounts, member account linking, payment allocation, and robust stock management. Backend tests passed 100%.
-   **Frontend (, )**:
    -   Eliminated all previous reliance on mock data and local test modes, connecting the UI to live backend APIs.
    -   Implemented a  utility for formatting receipts.
    -   Integrated per-item discount functionality directly into the cart UI.
    -   Added a receipt dialog with Print and Download options post-transaction.
-   **Testing**: Both automated backend and frontend tests were executed and passed with 100% success, confirming the stability and functionality of the completed POS system, including stock deduction, various transaction types, member linking, and comprehensive discount application.

The POS system, with its core features, is now fully functional and verified. The current conversation ended with the user asking about billing automation, signaling the next area of development.
