The AI engineer began by clarifying the extensive ERP360 gym management requirements from Miro and Excel documents. Initially, it built a basic MVP focused on member, access, and billing. Upon user feedback, the scope expanded incrementally to include sophisticated features like multi-level cancellation workflows, flexible levy systems, comprehensive member data with geo-location, structured package setup, and a sales commission engine. The AI demonstrated iterative development, debugging issues like environment variable syntax and frontend rendering. It utilized sub-agents for third-party integrations (WhatsApp, Social Media). The current work involves implementing an automation and trigger engine, which is partially complete. The trajectory shows a consistent effort to expand the application's functionality based on continuous user input, addressing complexities one by one, while adhering to technical guidelines and best practices for a full-stack application.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a gym member management application with biometric and QR code access, recurring billing via invoicing and debit orders. This evolved into a comprehensive ERP360 solution based on Miro board and Excel specifications. Key features include:
1.  **Member Management**: Registration, profiles, multi-site access, comprehensive details (bank, ID, address, contact) with geo-location.
2.  **Access Control**: QR Code, simulated biometric, real-time logs.
3.  **Membership Plans**: Types (upfront, debit order with rollover to recurring monthly), recurring billing, peak/off-peak sessions, structured package setup with naming protocols, variations, and discounts.
4.  **Recurring Billing & Invoicing**: Automated invoices, payment tracking, debit orders, half-year levies (annual/bi-annual, anniversary/fixed dates) with separate debiting and payment options (upfront/debit order) for all membership types.
5.  **Member Portal**: Login, QR display, view invoices & memberships.
6.  **Dashboard & Reports**: Statistics, payment summaries, debtor management.
7.  **Staff/User Management**: Role-based access control (permissions for staff).
8.  **Cancellation Workflow**: Multi-level authorization (email/app request, staff, line manager, head office admin).
9.  **Sales Commission Engine**: Consultant tracking, flexible commission structures, performance dashboards.
10. **Integrations**: WhatsApp (messaging in/out), Social Media (lead capture to consultant diaries).
11. **Automation/Triggers**: If this then do that workflows (e.g., failed debit order -> SMS/WhatsApp, member joins -> welcome message).

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Architecture**: React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
- **UI/UX**: Shadcn UI components, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI.
- **Backend**: Pydantic models, JWT authentication,  for async MongoDB,  for geocoding.
- **Database**: MongoDB (UUIDs for IDs, ISO strings for datetime).
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes environment, Supervisor for service management.
- **Integrations**:  for WhatsApp and Social Media (Facebook Graph API).
- **Security**: JWT_SECRET in .

<code_architecture>

-   ****: The main FastAPI application. This file has undergone extensive modifications throughout the development. It now includes:
    -   Authentication (login/logout).
    -   CRUD operations for members, membership types, billing, invoices.
    -   Endpoints for access control (QR/biometric simulation).
    -   Models and routes for cancellation requests with approval workflows.
    -   Models and routes for levy management (annual/bi-annual, separate billing).
    -   Integration of geocoding for member addresses and an endpoint for marketing analytics (member distribution).
    -   Models for consultants, commissions, membership variations, and duration templates.
    -   Placeholders/initial setup for WhatsApp, Social Media, and Automation logic.
-   ****: Stores environment variables like  and . Modified to add .
-   ****: Lists Python dependencies. Updated to include , , , , .
-   ****: A new script created to seed initial membership types into the database.
-   ****: The main React application component. It defines the application's routes using  and renders the appropriate page components. It has been continually updated to include new routes for Settings, Cancellations, Levies, Marketing, PackageSetup, Commissions, and Automations.
-   ****: Global CSS styles, likely includes Tailwind CSS configurations.
-   ****: A newly created component for navigation. It was updated multiple times to add links to all new pages like Settings, Cancellations, Levies, Marketing, Package Setup, Commissions, and Automations.
-   ****: A series of page components:
    -   **, , , , , **: Core pages for initial MVP.  was modified to include extensive new member details and geo-location fields.
    -   ****: Created and heavily modified to manage membership packages (creation/editing with payment types, levy configurations), staff users, and access rights.
    -   ****: Created to display and manage membership cancellation requests through a multi-level approval workflow.
    -   ****: Created to manage and display levy charges, explaining the separate billing mechanism.
    -   ****: Created to display member distribution on a map using  and show marketing analytics.
    -   ****: Created for structured creation of membership packages, including base memberships, duration templates, and variations/discounts.
    -   ****: Created for the sales commission engine and consultant performance dashboards.
    -   ****: Created for setting up trigger and automation rules.
-   ****: Node.js dependencies. Updated to include , , , , , .

<pending_tasks>
- Implement remaining aspects of Staff Access Control (separate from member access).
- Implement basic POS System functionality.
- Integrate WhatsApp and Social Media lead capture (playbooks received, but implementation is pending).
- Complete the sales commission engine logic and UI.
- Fully implement the automation and trigger engine (if-this-then-that workflows) backend and frontend.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary request, the AI engineer was working on implementing the triggers and automation engine functionality. It had started building the necessary backend models and logic, evidenced by a successful edit to the  file to incorporate automation logic. It had also created the corresponding frontend page  and updated routing and sidebar. The user then interrupted to ask about saving work to GitHub, which redirected the AI to call a . Therefore, the automation engine is in a partially implemented state, with initial backend setup and frontend page scaffolding complete, but the full integration and detailed logic for if this then do that workflows are still underway.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Continue building the triggers and automation engine as per user's request.
