The AI engineer has systematically built and refined the ERP360 gym management application, responding to evolving requirements. Initial efforts focused on establishing a core MVP, which then expanded to include complex features like a multi-level cancellation workflow, flexible levy systems, structured package setup, and a sales commission engine. A significant portion of the recent work involved implementing and enhancing the Automation and Trigger Engine, adding user-friendly condition builders, and integrating it into key member lifecycle events. The engineer also provided comprehensive documentation, including a feature summary PDF and a data flow map, the latter being updated to detail debit order batching. A critical bug in membership variation saving was addressed. The package setup functionality was extensively enhanced to support various payment options and member linking. Following a GitHub integration fix, the engineer successfully completed a multi-step task set, including frontend testing, member registration updates, and member portal enhancements. Most recently, a  WhatsApp integration was implemented and thoroughly tested in mock mode. The current task involves expanding the automation engine with a comprehensive, categorized list of user-configurable trigger scenarios.

<product_requirements>
The ERP360 gym management application aims to be a comprehensive solution covering member management, access control, and financial operations. Core requirements include detailed Member Management (profiles, geo-location, multi-site access), Access Control (QR/biometric), Membership Plans (structured packages, variations, discounts, configurable duration, auto-renewal, multiple payment options, linking multiple members), Recurring Billing & Invoicing (automated invoices, debit orders, half-year levies), Member Portal (self-service), Dashboard/Reports, Staff/User Management, a multi-level Cancellation Workflow, Sales Commission Engine (consultant tracking), and Integrations (WhatsApp, Social Media). A central feature is the Automation/Triggers engine, supporting if-this-then-do-that workflows, enhanced with a user-friendly condition builder and a comprehensive, categorized list of trigger scenarios (e.g., Bookings, Payment Management, Retention, Member Journey).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on enhancing the Automation and Trigger Engine to be more user-friendly and flexible. The user requested a comprehensive list of categorized trigger scenarios (e.g., Bookings, Payment Management, Retention, Member Journey) to be available via a dropdown.

The AI engineer has initiated this by:
1.  Updating the  file.
2.  The  constant within this file was modified to include the extensive, categorized list of new trigger scenarios, aligning with the user's detailed request.

The current state is that the data structure for these new triggers is present in the frontend, but the UI component for the trigger selection dropdown in  still needs to be updated to render these categorized options correctly and allow user interaction. The backend implications for handling these expanded trigger types would likely follow once the frontend structure is in place.
