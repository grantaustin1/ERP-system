The AI engineer has systematically expanded the ERP360 gym management application. Initial work included core features, billing, and RBAC, followed by comprehensive All Members screen phases (Dashboard Enhancements, Retention Intelligence, Report Library, Advanced Analytics, Engagement Features). The focus then shifted to the Sales Management Module, completing Phase 1 (MVP) backend and frontend, and Phase 2 (Advanced) backend APIs (Sales Automation, Workflow, Advanced Analytics). The engineer then implemented the corresponding frontend components, updated routing and navigation, and performed comprehensive backend and frontend testing. Critical bugs related to MongoDB ObjectId serialization and GET endpoint projection errors in the new sales configurations were identified and fixed. Subsequently, the engineer built out configurable lead sources, statuses, loss reasons, referral tracking, and member search APIs. Frontend lead forms were enhanced, and a Sales CRM Setup page was added. The latest task involves integrating an Attendance by Day Heatmap into the Members Dashboard and continuing with the comprehensive Sales Dashboard.

The ERP360 application is a gym management system for financial and member management. Initial features included EFT, DebiCheck, AVS, TI, Levy System, settings redesign, member search, engagement alerts, class booking, Member Journal, Tasking System, and Access Override. Recent developments enhanced the Today screen, refined billing automation, and implemented RBAC UI filtering. The All Members screen roadmap progressed through Dashboard Enhancements (Phase 2A), Retention Intelligence (2B), Report Library (2C), Advanced Analytics (2D), and Engagement Features (2E), which included points/rewards and a global search. The current focus is a new Sales Management Module. Phase 1 (MVP) involved Contact, Lead, Sales Pipeline, Task, and Basic Reporting. Phase 2 (Advanced) requires Sales Automation, Workflow Automation, Advanced Analytics Dashboard (including comprehensive dashboard analytics, drill-down capabilities), configurable lead sources (e.g., walk-in, referral with member linking/rewards), configurable lead statuses (e.g., called, joined, lost with configurable reasons), and an Attendance by Day Heatmap (hourly granularity) for the Members Dashboard.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was implementing Phase 2 of the Sales Management Module and addressing a new request for an attendance heatmap.
On the backend, comprehensive APIs for configurable lead sources, statuses, loss reasons, referral rewards, member search, and extensive sales dashboard analytics were added to . Critical bugs related to MongoDB  serialization in POST endpoints and incorrect  projection in GET endpoints were identified and fixed, ensuring that the backend configuration APIs and data seeding worked correctly and returned expected results.
On the frontend, the  page,  component,  component,  page, and  component were created. Routes in  and navigation links in  were updated. The  page was significantly enhanced to support new lead fields and referral tracking.  was updated to incorporate the advanced analytics. The  was created for mock API calls.
The user has provided an HTML reference for an Attendance by Day Heatmap and specified it should be added to the existing  dashboard under a new member analytics section, with hourly granularity.
The current activity is at the beginning of implementing this heatmap and continuing with the sales dashboard.
