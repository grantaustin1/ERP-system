The trajectory details the continued development of the ERP360 application, expanding its financial and member management capabilities. Initially, the AI engineer focused on robust financial features like EFT SDV, DebiCheck, AVS, and TI. Key architectural changes included a mega-menu Settings page and a Debit Order Management module. Subsequent work enhanced levy options, improved staff management links, and integrated member search and engagement alerts.

The conversation then transitions into adding template-based notification capabilities, integrating these templates into automation triggers, enhancing class booking features with searchable member selection, auto-advancing date inputs, and smart defaults. Critical fixes addressed CORS issues and datetime handling during booking creation. The scope further expanded to implement a hierarchical drill-down dashboard for class bookings and all statistical tiles, culminating in a request to add drill-down functionality to the Members tab for individual member profiles. Each feature was implemented iteratively, with frequent testing and debugging.

13. **Integrate Templates with Automations**: Allow selection of notification templates within automation triggers.
14. **Searchable Member Selector in Classes**: Replace dropdown with searchable input for member selection in class bookings.
15. **Auto-Advancing Date Selection**: Improve date/time input fields for class bookings (YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM) with auto-advance and pre-population.
16. **Aggregated Class Bookings View**: Dashboard tab showing total capacity vs booked slots, with drill-down to class list and then member list.
17. **Class Capacity Management UI**: Set and display capacity for classes.
18. **Class Attendance Tracking**: Link class bookings to access control for auto-attendance marking, track no-shows, and block members with excessive non-attendance (user-configurable thresholds).
19. **WhatsApp Booking Confirmations & Reminders**: Send WhatsApp message upon booking creation and a configurable reminder before class starts.
20. **Drill-Down on All Dashboard Tiles**: Make all dashboard statistical tiles clickable to view detailed lists (e.g., members, invoices), with a second level drill-down to individual profiles/details.
21. **Drill-Down in Members Tab**: Add drill-down from the member list to individual member profiles on the Members page.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was working on enhancing the dashboard and other key pages with multi-level drill-down capabilities. The last user request was to CAN YOU PLEASE ALSO ADD DRILL DOWN IN THE MEMBERS TAB.

The engineer responded by initiating the implementation of this feature.
1.  **Backend Changes**: No direct backend changes were required for this specific request, as the member profile data is already accessible.
2.  **Frontend Changes ()**:
    *   State for  and  was added to control the visibility and content of the member profile drill-down modal.
    *   The engineer identified the  section, specifically around line 758, where member cards are rendered. The current task is to modify these cards to make them clickable, triggering the display of the  with the  populated.
The system is currently in a state where most dashboard tiles support drill-down, and the next logical step is to extend this consistent UX pattern to the  page.

<optional_next_step>
Implement the drill-down functionality in  so clicking a member card shows their profile.
