The AI engineer successfully integrated ClubManager Today screen features into ERP360, focusing on dashboard and member management enhancements. The project was divided into three phases: (1) enhanced attendance display on member profiles, (2) dashboard improvements, and (3) a unified messaging system. The engineer performed a detailed analysis of the provided ClubManager HTML to extract key features. Backend APIs were updated in  to support new data, including retention metrics, payment progress, sales comparisons, KPIs, and birthday data, along with new messaging endpoints. Frontend development involved creating new React components (, , , , , , ) and integrating them into  and . Issues identified during testing, such as  handling and accessibility in , were addressed. The process included systematic backend and frontend testing, with a 100% success rate reported for all new enhancements after fixes.

The ERP360 gym management application aims to be a full-stack solution with comprehensive financial integrations and enhanced member management. The previously implemented features included EFT SDV, DebiCheck, AVS, TI, improved Levy System, a mega-menu Settings redesign, member search, engagement alerts dashboard, drill-down functionality across dashboard tiles and member profiles. It also had template-based notifications, class booking enhancements, a comprehensive Member Journal system, a Tasking System with configurable types, and an Access Override function.

The recent development focused on integrating features inspired by the ClubManager Today screen, explicitly requested by the user. This included:
1.  **Phase 1 (Member Profile Enhancements):** Enhanced attendance cards with visual retention indicators (color-coded, % change), payment progress bars (Paid/Unpaid/Remaining), recent journal previews, missing data warnings (e.g., Missing emergency contact details), and attendance streak counters.
2.  **Phase 2 (Dashboard Improvements):** A membership sales chart comparing current month vs. target, previous month, and last year; 12-week KPI sparklines; emails recently opened tracking; and an immediate bookings status panel.
3.  **Phase 3 (Communication System):** A unified messaging window for SMS/Email/Push, featuring a template selector, character counter for SMS, credit balance display, Save as new template checkbox, marketing message flag, Show on check-in option for push notifications, and integrated template management/SMS credit purchase options.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed the full implementation and testing of the ClubManager Today screen enhancements across both backend and frontend. This involved developing new backend APIs in  to provide data for member retention, payment progress, dashboard sales comparisons, KPIs, and birthday lists, as well as unified messaging functionalities. On the frontend, new React components (, , , , , , ) were created and integrated into  (for member-specific enhancements and a Send Message button) and  (for dashboard widgets). During frontend testing, a critical bug was identified in  related to the  component's  prop and the handling of none selections. Additionally, accessibility warnings were addressed by adding . These issues were successfully fixed, and a subsequent comprehensive testing run reported 100% success for all new features. The application is now in a state where these ClubManager-inspired features are fully integrated and functional.
