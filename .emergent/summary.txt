The AI engineer successfully transitioned the ERP360 gym management application from an initial MVP to a more feature-rich system, following an Incremental Rebuild strategy. Initially, the focus was on enhancing a payment system, including backend model updates, new CRUD APIs for , automated debt calculation, and frontend refactoring. Subsequently, the development shifted to a complete rebuild based on provided specifications. Key feature implementations include a Core Scheduling system (Classes & Bookings), Enhanced Access Control with check-in analytics, a redesigned generic Automations module, a comprehensive Data Import module with mapping, and robust Duplicate Data Entry Protection. Numerous bugs were identified and fixed, including UI rendering issues and API data handling. The engineer also generated a detailed document for potential collaboration with Julius AI and clarified deployment procedures. The current state involves troubleshooting a failed to fetch members error due to an earlier name splitting logic during import.

<product_requirements>
The ERP360 gym management application aims to be a comprehensive solution for member management, access control, and financial operations. It includes Member Management, Access Control, flexible Membership Plans, Recurring Billing & Invoicing, a Member Portal, Dashboard/Reports, Staff/User Management, multi-level Cancellation Workflow, Sales Commission Engine, and integrations like WhatsApp (Respond.io). A central Automation/Triggers engine supports  functionality.

Initial requirements focused on enhancing payment features: automatic debt calculation, editable payment sources (Walk-in, Online, Social Media, Phone-in, Referral, Canvassing, Flyers) linked to the Marketing module, and dashboards showing average payment duration globally/club/region/membership type. This enhancement was largely implemented.

The current overriding request is to completely rebuild the app from scratch based on , , , , and . The rebuild is proceeding incrementally, focusing on core features like Classes & Scheduling, Enhanced Access Control & Check-ins, a generic Automations module, a data import module with mapping, duplicate data entry protection, and an admin-configurable mandatory field system for member creation.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a user-reported issue: members tab when clicked says failed to fetch members. This occurred after the implementation of the  module, specifically after a fix was applied to split Full Name from CSV imports into  and  in .

The last action in the trajectory was the AI engineer investigating the failed to fetch members error, and the observation revealed a Pydantic  error for the  field in the member response. This indicates that the name splitting logic during import was flawed, leading to members being stored in the database with a  that might still contain titles or full names, and a missing or incorrectly parsed . The AI's latest step was to prepare to directly inspect and clean up the database to rectify these bad imports.

<optional_next_step>
Clean up the database by removing incorrectly imported member data, and then re-evaluate the name splitting logic in  for CSV imports.
