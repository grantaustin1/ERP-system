UI Framework: Shadcn UI + Tailwind CSS
Backend: Python FastAPI
Database: MongoDB (Motor async driver)
Authentication: JWT Bearer tokens
Deployment: Kubernetes + Supervisor
Environment: Docker containers
```

### Architecture Pattern
```
Monolithic Application with Microservices-Ready Structure

## 🔐 KEY IMPLEMENTATIONS

### 1. Duplicate Protection System

**Backend Logic:**
```python
# Checks before creating member:
1. Email exists? (case-insensitive)
2. Phone exists? (exact match)
3. Name exists? (first + last, case-insensitive)

# Returns 409 Conflict with duplicate details
```

**Duplicate Handling Options:**
```
Manual Entry: Block with error toast showing existing member
Bulk Import: 
  - Skip: Don't import duplicates
  - Update: Overwrite existing data
  - Create: Force create (not recommended)
```

**Result Tracking:**
```
Import results show:
- Created count
- Updated count
- Skipped count
- Failed count
- Error log with reasons
```

### 2. Field Configuration System

**Admin Control:**
```
For each field, admin can:
- Toggle required/optional
- View validation rules
- See field type
- Read error messages
```

**Validation Rules:**
```
Email: Must contain @ and .
Phone: 10-15 digits, numeric only
Text: Min/max length
Numbers: Numeric only, length restrictions
```

**Pre-configured Fields:**
```
13 fields across 5 categories:
- Basic: first_name, last_name, id_number
- Contact: email, phone, home_phone, work_phone, emergency_contact
- Address: address, postal_code
- Banking: bank_account_number, bank_name
- Membership: membership_type_id
```

### 3. Classes & Booking System

**Capacity Management:**
```python
if confirmed_bookings >= class_capacity:
    if allow_waitlist:
        status = "waitlist"
        waitlist_position = current_waitlist_count + 1
    else:
        raise "Class is full"
else:
    status = "confirmed"
```

**Waitlist Promotion:**
```python
when confirmed_booking cancelled:
    1. Find next waitlist booking (lowest position)
    2. Promote to confirmed
    3. Decrement all other waitlist positions
```

**Booking Restrictions:**
```
- Booking window: Can't book more than X days ahead
- Cancellation window: Can't cancel less than X hours before
- Membership type restrictions: Only certain types can book
```

### 4. Access Control Enhancement

**Validation Flow:**
```python
1. Check if member blocked (debt)
2. Check membership status (active/suspended/cancelled)
3. Check expiry date
4. If class booking: verify booking exists
5. Grant/Deny with detailed reason logging
```

**Analytics Computed:**
```
- Total attempts, granted, denied
- Success rate percentage
- Breakdown by access method
- Breakdown by location
- Denied reasons analysis
- Peak hours identification (by hour)
- Top 10 members by check-in count
```

### 5. Automation Template System

**Structure:**
```javascript
{
  id: 'welcome_new_member',
  category: 'Member Onboarding',
  trigger: 'member_joined',
  defaultAction: 'send_whatsapp',
  defaultMessage: 'Welcome {member_name}!...',
  parameters: [
    { name: 'delay_minutes', type: 'number', default: 5 }
  ]
}
```

**User Experience:**
```
1. Select template from dropdown
2. Form auto-populates
3. Choose channel (WhatsApp/SMS/Email)
4. Edit message (variables supported)
5. Configure parameters
6. Toggle test mode
7. Enable automation
```

### 6. Data Import with Mapping

**CSV Processing:**
```
1. Parse CSV → extract headers
2. Show sample data (first 5 rows)
3. Display total row count
4. User maps CSV columns → DB fields
5. Auto-map suggests matches
6. Required fields validation
7. Duplicate detection during import
8. Batch insert with error logging
```

**Field Mapping UI:**
```
For each DB field:
- Show label + required indicator
- Dropdown with CSV columns
- Select "Not Mapped" if not present
```

✅ Pagination ready (limit parameter)
```

### Frontend
```
✅ React functional components + hooks
✅ Shadcn UI component library
✅ Tailwind CSS utility classes
✅ Axios for API calls
✅ Toast notifications (sonner)

```

### Database
```
✅ No ObjectId (UUID strings only)
✅ Denormalized where needed (member_name in bookings)
✅ ISO string dates
✅ Embedded documents for simple relationships
✅ Reference IDs for complex relationships
✅ Indexes on frequently queried fields (planned)
```

## 🎓 KEY LEARNINGS & DECISIONS

### Architecture Decisions
1. **MongoDB over SQL:** Flexibility for gym-specific data models
2. **FastAPI over Flask:** Better async support and auto-documentation
3. **JWT over Sessions:** Stateless authentication for scalability
4. **UUID over Auto-increment:** Better for distributed systems
5. **Shadcn over Material-UI:** More customizable, better Tailwind integration

### Feature Decisions
1. **Template-based automations:** Easier for non-technical users than rule builders
2. **Duplicate protection mandatory:** Critical for data integrity
3. **Field configuration by admin:** Different gyms have different requirements
4. **Waitlist auto-promotion:** Reduces manual work for staff
5. **Test mode for automations:** Safety feature before production

### UX Decisions
1. **Dark theme:** Modern, reduces eye strain for staff
2. **Toast notifications:** Non-intrusive feedback
3. **Card-based layouts:** Scannable information
4. **Dropdown over free text:** Data consistency
5. **Visual progress indicators:** User confidence

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS (ROADMAP)

### Immediate (This Sprint)
1. Integrate field configuration into member forms
2. Add real-time validation using /validate-field endpoint
3. Complete staff permissions (functional implementation)
4. Add export functionality to reports

### Short-term (Next Sprint)
1. Build POS/Retail module
2. Implement document signing (waivers)
3. Enhanced reporting with charts
4. Email/SMS actual sending (not just logging)

### Medium-term
1. Payment gateway integration (Stripe/PayPal)
2. Mobile app (React Native)
3. Multi-location support
4. Advanced analytics dashboard
5. Automated commission calculations

### Long-term
1. AI-powered member insights
2. Predictive churn analysis
3. Social media integrations
4. Public API for third-party integrations
5. White-label solution for franchises

## 📝 NOTES FOR JULIUS

### Strengths of This Build
- Comprehensive duplicate protection
- Admin-configurable validation
- Intelligent import with field mapping
- Template-based automations (user-friendly)
- Detailed access control with analytics
- Complete classes/scheduling with auto-waitlist
- Dark, modern UI
- Production-ready error handling

### Areas for Improvement
- Member forms don't yet use field configuration
- No actual email/SMS sending (structure in place)
- Payment gateway not integrated
- Limited reporting
- No mobile app
- Basic permissions (UI only)

### What Would Help
- Your approach to complex forms with dynamic validation
- How you handle payment gateway integration
- Your reporting/analytics implementation
- Mobile app architecture if you built one
- Multi-tenancy/multi-location strategy
- Testing strategy and coverage
