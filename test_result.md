# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      Automation Engine implementation completed. 
      
      Backend features:
      - Full CRUD API for automation rules
      - Trigger execution engine with condition checking
      - Action executors for SMS, WhatsApp, Email, Status Update, Task Creation (SMS/WhatsApp/Email are mocked, real integration pending)
      - Integrated triggers into member_joined, payment_failed, and invoice_overdue events
      - Execution history tracking
      - Test endpoint for automation validation
      
      Frontend features:
      - Complete Automations page with tabs for rules and execution history
      - Visual rule builder with trigger and action selection
      - Support for multiple actions with delays
      - Dynamic form fields based on action type
      - Enable/disable toggle, edit, delete, and test functionality
      - Execution history view with status badges
      
      Testing priority:
      1. Test automation CRUD operations (create, list, update, delete)
      2. Test automation toggle (enable/disable)
      3. Test creating automation with different trigger types
      4. Test adding multiple actions to a single automation
      5. Test member registration triggering member_joined automation
      6. Test marking invoice as failed triggering payment_failed automation
      7. Test execution history display
      8. Test automation test endpoint with sample data
      
      Please test all backend endpoints first, then test the frontend UI and end-to-end workflows.

      🎉 AUTOMATION ENGINE BACKEND TESTING COMPLETED - ALL SYSTEMS OPERATIONAL
      
      COMPREHENSIVE TEST RESULTS (100% Success Rate - 20/20 tests passed):
      
      ✅ AUTOMATION CRUD OPERATIONS:
      - GET /api/automations: Successfully lists all automation rules
      - POST /api/automations: Creates new automations with proper validation
      - GET /api/automations/{id}: Retrieves specific automation details
      - PUT /api/automations/{id}: Updates automation rules correctly
      - DELETE /api/automations/{id}: Removes automations successfully
      
      ✅ AUTOMATION CONTROL:
      - POST /api/automations/{id}/toggle: Enable/disable functionality working perfectly
      
      ✅ AUTOMATION TESTING:
      - POST /api/automations/test/{id}: Test endpoint executes automations with sample data without database persistence
      
      ✅ EXECUTION HISTORY:
      - GET /api/automation-executions: Returns execution history with proper filtering
      - Execution records contain complete trigger_data, results, and timestamps
      
      ✅ TRIGGER INTEGRATIONS (All Working):
      - Member Joined: Creating members via POST /api/members triggers member_joined automations
      - Payment Failed: POST /api/invoices/{id}/mark-failed triggers payment_failed automations  
      - Invoice Overdue: POST /api/invoices/{id}/mark-overdue triggers invoice_overdue automations
      
      ✅ ACTION EXECUTORS (All 5 Types Tested):
      - send_sms: **MOCKED** - Returns sent_mock status with proper message templating
      - send_whatsapp: **MOCKED** - Returns sent_mock status with proper message templating  
      - send_email: **MOCKED** - Returns sent_mock status with subject/body templating
      - update_member_status: REAL - Updates member status in database
      - create_task: REAL - Creates task records in database
      
      ✅ ADVANCED FEATURES:
      - Complex conditions with operators (>=, <=, ==, contains) working correctly
      - Multiple actions per automation with delay scheduling
      - Message templating with variables ({member_name}, {amount}, etc.)
      - Proper error handling and validation
      
      🔧 BUGS FIXED DURING TESTING:
      - Fixed member.full_name -> member.first_name + member.last_name in trigger data
      - Fixed phone_primary -> phone field references in all triggers
      
      🚀 READY FOR PRODUCTION:
      All backend automation functionality is working correctly. SMS/WhatsApp/Email actions are mocked and ready for real service integration. The automation engine successfully handles complex workflows with conditions, multiple actions, and proper execution tracking.
