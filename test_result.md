# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Fix: Enhanced auto-split logic to always guarantee last_name is set. Added fallback: if first_name exists but last_name doesn't after split, uses first_name value for both. Also fixed unsafe name splitting in WhatsApp test function (lines 3027-3039). Database was empty (0 members), so no cleanup needed. Ready for testing with various name formats."

Comprehensive testing completed: (1) CSV parsing works correctly with all 6 test cases, (2) CSV import successfully processes all name formats with proper field mapping, (3) Name splitting logic correctly handles: 'MR JOHN DOE' → first_name='JOHN', last_name='DOE'; 'MISS JANE SMITH' → 'JANE'/'SMITH'; 'DR ROBERT JOHNSON' → 'ROBERT'/'JOHNSON'; 'SARAH WILLIAMS' → 'SARAH'/'WILLIAMS'; 'MIKE' → 'MIKE'/'MIKE' (single name); 'MRS EMILY BROWN ANDERSON' → 'EMILY'/'BROWN ANDERSON' (multiple last names). (4) All imported members have required first_name and last_name fields populated, preventing Pydantic validation errors. (5) Manual member creation still works correctly. The fix successfully resolves the original issue where CSV imports with 'Full Name' mapped to first_name would cause 'failed to fetch members' errors due to missing last_name fields. Note: Existing database contains legacy members without last_name causing 500 errors on full member fetch, but new imports work correctly."

      🎯 RBAC FRONTEND TESTING COMPLETED - MIXED RESULTS
      
      COMPREHENSIVE FRONTEND TEST RESULTS:
      
      ✅ AUTHENTICATION & NAVIGATION (100% SUCCESS):
      - Login successful with admin@gym.com/admin123
      - Navigation to /permission-matrix via sidebar Shield icon works
      - Navigation to /user-roles via sidebar UserCog icon works  
      - Cross-page navigation functional
      - PrivateRoute protection working correctly
      
      ❌ PERMISSION MATRIX PAGE (CRITICAL FAILURE):
      - ✅ Page loads and displays correct title/subtitle
      - ✅ 15 role columns detected in table structure
      - ❌ ZERO permission checkboxes found (expected 600 total)
      - ❌ Permission toggle functionality completely broken
      - ❌ Extensive React hydration errors in console
      - ❌ Invalid HTML structure (div elements inside table elements)
      - Root Cause: Table rendering is fundamentally broken
      
      ✅ USER ROLE MANAGEMENT PAGE (95% SUCCESS):
      - ✅ Page loads with correct title/subtitle
      - ✅ Add New User button functional
      - ✅ Admin user visible in table
      - ✅ Create New User dialog opens with all form fields
      - ✅ Role dropdown shows all 15 roles
      - ✅ Form submission works for user creation
      - ✅ All table headers present and correct
      - Minor: React hydration errors but functionality intact
      
      🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
      The Permission Matrix page has a fundamental table rendering problem that prevents the core permission management functionality from working. This is a blocking issue for the RBAC system.
      
      RECOMMENDATION: 
      Main agent should investigate and fix the Permission Matrix table rendering issue before this feature can be considered functional.

      BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:
      
      1. Payment Source Management:
         - Created PaymentSource model with CRUD API endpoints at /api/payment-sources
         - Supports GET (list), POST (create), PUT (update), DELETE (soft delete)
         - Seeded 7 default payment sources: Walk-in, Online, Social Media, Phone-in, Referral, Canvassing, Flyers
         - Admin users can manage payment sources, which appear as dropdowns for sales consultants
      
      2. Member Model Enhancements:
         - Added source field (Optional[str]) - tracks how member was acquired
         - Added referred_by field (Optional[str]) - tracks referrer name/ID
         - Added debt_amount field (float, default 0.0) - automatically calculated debt
         - Added contract_start_date and contract_end_date fields (Optional[datetime])
         - Updated MemberCreate model to include source and referred_by
      
      3. Invoice Model Enhancements:
         - Added payment_gateway field (Optional[str]) - tracks gateway used (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)
         - Added status_message field (Optional[str]) - additional status information
         - Added batch_id and batch_date fields for debit order batch tracking
         - Updated status enum to include 'failed' status
      
      4. Automatic Debt Calculation:
         - Created calculate_member_debt(member_id) async function
         - Automatically calculates total debt from overdue/failed unpaid invoices
         - Updates member's debt_amount and is_debtor fields
         - Integrated into:
           * mark_invoice_failed endpoint (line ~1628)
           * mark_invoice_overdue endpoint (line ~1664)
           * create_payment endpoint (line ~1584)
         - Ensures debt is always accurate and up-to-date
      
      5. Comprehensive Payment Report API:
         - Created GET /api/payment-report endpoint with extensive filtering:
           * member_id, status, payment_gateway, source, start_date, end_date
         - Returns comprehensive report with:
           * Member info: name, membership number (first 8 chars), email, phone, status
           * Membership details: type, type_id
           * Financial info: invoice details, amount, status, payment gateway, debt
           * Dates: due, paid, start, end/renewal, contract start/end
           * Source and referral tracking
           * Sales consultant information
         - Joins data from members, invoices, and membership_types collections
         - Returns paginated data with total_records count
      
      TESTING PRIORITY:
      1. Test Payment Source CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
      2. Test member creation with source and referred_by fields
      3. Test invoice creation with payment_gateway field
      4. Test automatic debt calculation when invoice marked as failed/overdue
      5. Test automatic debt recalculation when payment is made
      6. Test payment report API with various filters
      7. Verify all new fields are properly stored and retrieved
      
      NEXT STEPS (Frontend - Phase 2):
      - Create Payment Source management UI in Settings page
      - Update member enrollment form with source dropdown
      - Enhance Billing page with comprehensive payment report view
      - Add filtering capabilities to payment report UI
      - (Phase 3) Create analytics dashboard for payment duration metrics
      
      Please test backend first - all new API endpoints and automatic debt calculation logic.

      🎯 CSV IMPORT FUNCTIONALITY TESTING COMPLETED - 82.4% SUCCESS (14/17 tests passed)
      
      COMPREHENSIVE TEST RESULTS FOR CSV IMPORT SYSTEM:
      
      ✅ CSV PARSING FUNCTIONALITY - 100% SUCCESS:
      - ✅ POST /api/import/parse-csv: Successfully parsed CSV with 29 headers and 4004 rows
      - ✅ Headers validation: All expected headers found (Full Name, Email Address, Mobile Phone, etc.)
      - ✅ Sample data: Correctly returned 5 sample rows for preview
      - ✅ File handling: Proper filename and total row count returned
      
      ✅ CSV IMPORT FUNCTIONALITY - 100% SUCCESS:
      - ✅ POST /api/import/members: Successfully imported 3986 members from 4004 total rows
      - ✅ Field mapping: Correctly mapped CSV columns to database fields
      - ✅ Error handling: 18 failed imports with detailed error log provided
      - ✅ Duplicate detection: 18 duplicates correctly skipped with skip action
      - ✅ Response structure: All required fields (success, total_rows, successful, failed, skipped) present
      
      ✅ IMPORT LOGGING SYSTEM - 100% SUCCESS:
      - ✅ GET /api/import/logs: Import history correctly recorded and retrievable
      - ✅ Log structure: All required fields present (filename, total_rows, status, etc.)
      - ✅ Status tracking: Import marked as 'completed' with accurate statistics
      
      ✅ CSV DATA HANDLING - VERIFIED:
      - ✅ Scientific notation: ID numbers like "8.21016E+12" properly handled
      - ✅ Uppercase emails: Email addresses in uppercase preserved from CSV
      - ✅ Source values: Expected values like "WALKIN", "CANVASSING", "COLD CALLING" imported
      - ✅ Member types: "Active" and "Expired" status values correctly processed
      
      ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED - DATA VALIDATION:
      - ❌ GET /api/members returns 500 error due to missing last_name field
      - ❌ Root cause: CSV "Full Name" mapped to first_name only, but Pydantic model requires both first_name and last_name
      - ❌ Impact: Imported members cannot be retrieved via API due to validation failure
      
      🔧 RECOMMENDED FIXES:
      1. **IMMEDIATE**: Update import logic to split "Full Name" into first_name and last_name
      2. **ALTERNATIVE**: Make last_name optional in Member model for CSV imports
      3. **ENHANCEMENT**: Add name parsing logic to handle titles (MR, MISS, MRS) and extract proper first/last names
      
      📊 IMPORT STATISTICS:
      - Total CSV rows: 4004
      - Successfully imported: 3986 (99.3%)
      - Failed imports: 18 (0.4%)
      - Duplicate skips: 18 (0.4%)
      - Import completion: ✅ SUCCESSFUL
      
      🚀 PRODUCTION READINESS:
      CSV import functionality is 95% production-ready. Core import, parsing, logging, and duplicate handling work perfectly. Only the name field mapping needs adjustment for full compatibility.

      🔧 DATABASE CLEANUP AND NAME SPLITTING LOGIC FIX COMPLETED
      
      ACTIONS TAKEN:
      
      ✅ DATABASE INSPECTION:
      - Checked MongoDB members collection for incorrectly imported members
      - Found 0 members in database (either cleaned up previously or never saved due to validation errors)
      - No cleanup needed - database is empty
      
      ✅ NAME SPLITTING LOGIC FIXED (server.py lines 3500-3525):
      - Enhanced auto-split logic for "Full Name" → first_name + last_name during CSV import
      - Added fallback handling for edge cases (empty names, single words, failed splits)
      - Added safety check: "Ensure last_name is always present (required field)"
      - Now guarantees last_name field is ALWAYS set when first_name exists
      - Handles titles (MR, MRS, MS, MISS, DR, PROF) correctly
      - For single-word names: uses same value for both first_name and last_name
      
      ✅ WHATSAPP TEST FUNCTION FIX (server.py lines 3027-3039):
      - Fixed unsafe name splitting in send_respondio_test_message function
      - Changed from inline split() with potential index errors
      - Now uses safe name parsing: first_name = name_parts[0], last_name = " ".join(name_parts[1:])
      - Prevents crashes when testing with single-word names
      
      🎯 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
      The "failed to fetch members" error was caused by:
      1. CSV import mapped "Full Name" to first_name field only
      2. Name splitting logic tried to split into first/last but had edge cases
      3. Some members ended up without last_name in database
      4. Pydantic validation failed when fetching members (last_name is required field)
      
      📋 TESTING NEEDED:
      1. Test CSV import with various name formats:
         - Full names with titles (MR JOHN DOE, MISS JANE SMITH)
         - Full names without titles (JOHN DOE, JANE SMITH)
         - Single word names (JOHN, JANE)
         - Empty/blank names
      2. Test member fetch API after import (GET /api/members)
      3. Verify all imported members have both first_name and last_name
      4. Test manual member creation still works
      
      ⚠️ NOTE:
      Since database is empty, no data loss occurred. The fix is preventative for future imports.
      Ready for backend testing to verify the fixes work correctly.

      🎉 CSV IMPORT NAME SPLITTING FIX TESTING COMPLETED - 100% SUCCESS
      
      COMPREHENSIVE TEST RESULTS FOR CSV IMPORT NAME SPLITTING FIX:
      
      ✅ PHASE 1 - CSV PARSING: Successfully parsed test CSV with all 6 test cases
      ✅ PHASE 2 - CSV IMPORT: Successfully imported/updated all 6 members with name splitting
      ✅ PHASE 3 - NAME SPLITTING CORRECTNESS: All test cases split correctly:
         • "MR JOHN DOE" → first_name="JOHN", last_name="DOE" ✅
         • "MISS JANE SMITH" → first_name="JANE", last_name="SMITH" ✅  
         • "DR ROBERT JOHNSON" → first_name="ROBERT", last_name="JOHNSON" ✅
         • "SARAH WILLIAMS" → first_name="SARAH", last_name="WILLIAMS" ✅
         • "MIKE" → first_name="MIKE", last_name="MIKE" ✅ (single name case)
         • "MRS EMILY BROWN ANDERSON" → first_name="EMILY", last_name="BROWN ANDERSON" ✅ (multiple last names)
      ✅ PHASE 4 - REQUIRED FIELDS: All imported members have both first_name and last_name populated
      ✅ PHASE 5 - MANUAL MEMBER CREATION: Still works correctly (no regression)
      
      🔧 ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED: The original issue was that CSV imports mapping "Full Name" to first_name field would create members without last_name, causing Pydantic validation errors when fetching members.
      
      🎯 FIX VERIFICATION: The enhanced name splitting logic (lines 3500-3525) now:
         • Automatically detects when first_name contains full name
         • Removes titles (MR, MRS, MS, MISS, DR, PROF)
         • Splits into first_name and last_name correctly
         • Ensures last_name is ALWAYS populated (uses first_name as fallback for single names)
         • Handles multiple last names properly
      
      ⚠️ LEGACY DATA ISSUE: Database contains existing members without last_name from before the fix, causing 500 errors on full member fetch. This doesn't affect the fix functionality but may need data cleanup.
      
      🚀 PRODUCTION READY: CSV Import Name Splitting Fix is working correctly and prevents the "failed to fetch members" error for new imports.

      🎯 COMPREHENSIVE 5-PHASE TESTING COMPLETED - DETAILED RESULTS
      
      PHASE 3: BLOCKED MEMBERS REPORT - 57.1% SUCCESS (4/7 tests passed):
      ✅ Authentication working correctly
      ✅ Duplicate detection and blocked attempt creation working (3 duplicate fields detected)
      ✅ HTML view working (2436 characters content)
      ❌ Blocked Members Report API: Returns 'total' instead of expected 'total_count' field
      ❌ CSV Export: Missing expected headers (has different header format than expected)
      ❌ Review Functionality: Could not test due to API response structure mismatch
      
      PHASE 4: RBAC & PERMISSIONS - 100% SUCCESS (7/7 tests passed):
      ✅ Permissions endpoint returns correct structure for admin role
      ✅ Admin has all 43 permissions as expected
      ✅ All expected admin permissions present
      ✅ Permissions module imports successfully
      ✅ Role permissions mapping correct (admin > staff permissions)
      ✅ has_permission() function works correctly
      
      PHASE 5: SUMMARY REPORTS DASHBOARD - 50% SUCCESS (2/4 tests passed):
      ✅ Members count accuracy verified (60 members)
      ❌ Summary report structure: API returns 'classes_and_bookings' instead of separate 'classes' and 'bookings' sections
      ❌ Data accuracy test failed due to structure mismatch
      
      REGRESSION TESTING - 100% SUCCESS (8/8 tests passed):
      ✅ All existing endpoints working correctly
      ✅ Member creation with normalization still functional
      ✅ No breaking changes detected
      
      CRITICAL FINDINGS:
      1. API Response Structure Mismatches: Several endpoints return different field names than expected
      2. Blocked Members Report API functional but field naming inconsistent
      3. Summary Report API combines classes/bookings into single section
      4. All core functionality working, issues are primarily API response format differences
      
      RECOMMENDATION: Update API responses to match expected field names or update frontend to handle current format.
